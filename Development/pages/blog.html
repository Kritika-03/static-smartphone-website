					<h1>What is Technology</h1><br>
					<p>
						With the growing advancement, technology has lost its specific definition and has become an umbrella term to define innovations in the digital world. However to put it simply, technology is the knowledge or tools used to make our lives easier. It has developed astronomically over the years, and will continue to do so with the increasing demand. Many, if not all, platforms have moved over to the internet, gaining more popularity as well as competition. Most business nowadays are available online since it’s more efficient and cost effective in addition to more customer flow. But we have to look back at history, we can see how far we’ve reached when we compare the advancement in technology now and back then.

					<h1> History</h1><br>
					<p>
						Ecommerce and all the different services provided to the public today are all through the internet. Most of these services emerged after the internet was publicly accessible in 1993. Online shopping was invented by Michael Aldrich in 1979 by connecting a modified domestic television to a real-time transaction processing computer with a telephone line. However, it became widely used after the internet was open to the mass. Shortly after the internet was available, Amazon, now an enormous ecommerce site, was founded.

					<h1>Advantages</h1><br>
					<p>
						Owning an online business is a lot less expensive compared to a physical store. We can code a website or use and already hosted one. Bringing the website online gives you a higher chance of consumer influx and increased popularity since they are more accessible in the network.
					</p><br>
					<p>
						Having your store online is more flexible and efficient. You can instantly change your display, items and layout according to customer demands without taking up much time or space. Adding on, your business is literally portable since you need a device and an internet connection to access it. This is a major reason for businesses to move to online platforms as consumers are globally available at any moment.  
					</p><br>
					<p>
						Another major advantage of technology to businesses is data. We can collect data about customer behavior and modify future business plans accordingly. Data about any customer action can be recorded and businesses can advertise accordingly to increase popularity and follow the trend. This would not be possible without technology advancements. Business plans which used to be dependent on one-sided reports and predictions are now dependent on more concrete data which if utilized properly can be a goldmine for businesses.

					<h1>Disadvantages</h1><br>
					<p>
						Despite its numerous benefits, using technology for online business is only fruitful if done right. In other words, it can be a double edged sword. If you only have your business online, it’s important that your website is impressive since an average user views a website for less than a minute. If your presentation is lacking, you won’t be able to retain customers.
					</p><br>
					<p>
						Another disadvantage could be adaptability. You should be able to make your business available in any device or platform since there is a diversity in the type of users and focusing on only one platform means you are severely decreasing your potential customers. 
					</p><br>
					<p>
						Security of data should be a priority of the business if they want to implement technology. Especially in ecommerce websites where there are sensitive data, weak security could mean compromising the privacy of a customer. This could lead to a bad credit or as far as a complete shutdown of the business.
